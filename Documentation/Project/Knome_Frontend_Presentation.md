# 📌 Slide 1: Knome Frontend Overview & Tech Stack

## 🚀 Welcome to Knome Frontend Architecture

Knome is an enterprise knowledge-sharing social platform (Hybrid of LinkedIn, Medium, and YouTube) built specifically for **MPOnline Limited**.

### 🛠️ Core Technology Stack
| Layer / Tech | Purpose & Role in Knome |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React 18** | UI Library for building interactive, component-based user interfaces |
| **Vite 5** | Lightning-fast build tool and local development server (`npm run dev`) |
| **Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS** | Design system with custom variables, smooth glassmorphism, and responsive design |
| **React Router v6** | Single Page Application (SPA) client-side routing |
| **SignalR Client** | WebSockets client for live real-time notifications (`/hubs/notifications`) |
| **Axios (`apiClient.js`)** | HTTP client with automatic JWT bearer token injection & response unwrapping |

---
> [!TIP]
> **Key Takeaway:** The frontend is a SPA (Single Page Application) that never reloads the page when navigating between screens.

# 🏗️ Slide 2: Folder Structure & Architecture Blueprint

## 📁 How Code is Organized inside `src/`

```mermaid
graph TD
    App[src/App.jsx - Router & Provider Shell] --> Layout[Layout & Navbar / Sidebar / Footer]
    App --> Contexts[React Context Providers]
    App --> Pages[15+ Feature Pages]
    
    Contexts --> UserCtx[UserContext - Auth & JWT]
    Contexts --> AudioCtx[AudioContext - Global Podcast Player]
    Contexts --> ModalCtx[ModalContext - Dialogs & Creation Windows]
    Contexts --> ToastCtx[ToastContext - Live Notifications]
    
    Pages --> Widgets[Reusable UI Widgets]
    Pages --> Modals[Interactive Modals & Popups]
    Pages --> Services[apiService.js - Axios API Layer]
```

### Directory Breakdown:
1. `src/pages/`: Contains full page components (Dashboard, Articles, AdminConsole, etc.).
2. `src/components/layout/`: Holds common shell layout (Navbar, Sidebar, Footer, AuthGuard).
3. `src/components/contexts/`: Holds global React Contexts (User authentication, Audio player, Toast alerts).
4. `src/components/modals/`: Popup dialogs (Create Post, Upload Video/Podcast, Moderation, Suspend User).
5. `src/components/widgets/`: Reusable small cards (Hot Posts, Trending Tags, Global Audio Player).
6. `src/utils/`: Centralized API calls (`apiService.js`), HTTP interceptors (`apiClient.js`), and helper scripts.

# 🔑 Slide 3: Authentication & Security Flow (JWT)

## 🔐 How User Login & Security Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as 👤 User (Employee)
    participant UI as 📱 Login Page
    participant Storage as 💾 LocalStorage / Context
    participant API as ⚙️ ASP.NET Core API

    User->>UI: Enters Employee ID (e.g. EMP001) & Password
    UI->>API: POST /api/Auth/login
    API-->>UI: Returns JWT Token & User Profile (Role: HRAdmin / Employee)
    UI->>Storage: Stores token in localStorage ('knome_jwt')
    UI->>Storage: Updates UserContext state (currentUser)
    UI->>UI: Redirects to /dashboard
```

### 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- **`Employee`**: Can read/create posts, articles, videos, podcasts, and manage their own profile.
- **`Community Admin`**: Can moderate specific community posts & manage members.
- **`HR Administrator`**: Access to **HR Analytics**, **Job Management**, and Department/Role changes.
- **`System Administrator`**: Access to **Admin Console**, **Audit Trail**, System Config & User Suspension.

# 🌐 Slide 4: Centralized API Layer (`apiService.js` & `apiClient.js`)

## ⚡ How Frontend Connects with Backend Database

Instead of making direct `fetch()` calls in every component, all HTTP requests go through a unified API layer:

### 1. `apiClient.js` (The Interceptor)
- Automatically attaches the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every request.
- Automatically unwraps `ApiResponse<T>` from backend so components directly get clean data.
- Handles global network errors and 401 Unauthorized redirects.

### 2. Service Modules inside `apiService.js`:
- **`authApi`**: Login, token verification, logout.
- **`postsApi`**: Fetch feed, create post, react, share.
- **`articlesApi`**: Fetch articles, bookmark, search.
- **`videosApi` & `podcastsApi`**: Upload media, fetch streaming URLs.
- **`adminApi`**: Fetch user list, suspend user (`PUT /users/{id}/suspend`), fetch audit logs.
- **`interactionsApi`**: Post comments, report content, fetch pending moderation reports.

# 🎛️ Slide 6: Deep Dive into Admin Console & Moderation Queue

## 🛡️ Governance & Moderation Infrastructure

The **Admin Console** (`AdminConsole.jsx`) is the command center for system admins and moderators.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Admin[👤 Admin User] --> Tabs[Admin Console Tabs]
    Tabs --> UsersTab[1. Users & Roles]
    Tabs --> ModTab[2. Moderation Queue]
    Tabs --> ConfigTab[3. System Config]
    Tabs --> AuditTab[4. Audit Trail]
    
    ModTab --> Pending[Fetches Pending Reports from SQL]
    Pending --> Actions[Actions: Ignore / Remove Content / Suspend User]
    Actions --> AuditLog[Appends Entry to Audit Logs & DB]
```

### Key Features of Admin Console:
1. **User Management**: Search users by name/department, change roles, and trigger user suspension modal.
2. **Moderation Queue**: Displays all reported posts with reporter name and reason. Admins can click **Remove Content** or **Suspend User**.
3. **System Config**: Live toggles for Maintenance Mode, Auto-Moderation Engine, Upload Limits Slider, and JWT TTL duration.
4. **Audit Trail**: Real-time immutable event log recording every action with exact timestamp and moderator ID. Includes **+ Test Audit Log** button and CSV/Excel/PDF export.

# 🎧 Slide 7: Global Audio & Media Systems

## 🎶 Seamless Audio & Video Experience

```mermaid
graph TD
    Podcasts[Podcasts.jsx Screen] --> PlayBtn[User Clicks 'Play Episode']
    PlayBtn --> AudioContext[Global AudioContext.jsx]
    AudioContext --> PlayerWidget[GlobalAudioPlayer.jsx - Persistent Bottom Bar]
    PlayerWidget --> AudioEl[HTML5 Audio Engine]
    AudioEl --> Controls[Play / Pause / Seek / Volume / Speed (1x-2x)]
```

### Media Engine Architecture:
- **Global Audio Player**: Playing a podcast episode doesn't stop when navigating to other pages! The `AudioContext` maintains the current playing state globally across the entire app.
- **High-Resolution Photos & Avatars**: All avatars use high-definition bold rendering (`256px`), and stock cover photos are scaled up to `1600px Ultra HD` (`q=90&w=1600`) with CSS hardware acceleration (`-webkit-optimize-contrast`).

<!-- slide -->

# 🎨 Slide 8: State Management & UI Design Tokens

## 🖌️ Visual Aesthetics & Global React Contexts

### 1. Global Contexts (`src/components/contexts/`)
- **`UserContext`**: Keeps track of `currentUser`, login status, JWT token, and logout helpers.
- **`ModalContext`**: Controls opening and closing of global creation dialogs (Create Post, Upload Video, Create Community).
- **`ToastContext`**: Triggers floating success/error alerts in the top-right corner.
- **`AudioContext`**: Manages global podcast track playback.

### 2. Design System (`index.css` + Tailwind)
- **Primary Color**: Deep Indigo / Slate (`#4f46e5`, `#1e293b`).
- **Accent Colors**: Electric Blue (`#3b82f6`), Emerald Green (`#10b981`), Warning Amber (`#f59e0b`), Error Red (`#ef4444`).
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle translucent backgrounds with `backdrop-blur-md` for modern card aesthetics.
- **Micro-Animations**: Dynamic hover scales, active button press depth (`active:scale-95`), and smooth tab transitions.
