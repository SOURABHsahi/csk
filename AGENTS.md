# AGENTS.md — Knome (MPOnline Limited)

## Identity

Enterprise knowledge management platform (LinkedIn/Medium/YouTube hybrid) for MPOnline Limited.
Monorepo with two top-level packages: `Backend/Knome.API` (ASP.NET Core 10) + `Frontend/knome-web` (React/Vite/TypeScript).

## Existing Instruction Files

- `CLAUDE.md` — primary project instructions (read first every session)
- `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — current phase, architecture decisions, known issues
- `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_STATUS.md` — detailed phase-by-phase status, verification commands, test credentials

## Critical Constraints

- **Never** manually modify `Models/` or `Data/KnomeDbContext.cs` — they are scaffolded
- **Never** modify scaffolded code at all; DB schema changes originate from SQL Server only
- **Re-scaffold** whenever DB changes (`dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold ...`)
- Business logic belongs in `Services/`, repositories in `Repositories/`, controllers stay thin
- External integrations (HRMS SSO, email digests, HRMS sync) are **deferred** — no dummy implementations

## Source-of-Truth Hierarchy

Functional Requirements Document (FRD) → DB schema → codebase → project docs.
If conflict exists between sources, explain before implementing.
If implementation differs from the FRD due to an approved architectural decision, **preserve the implementation** and document the reason before making changes.

## Build & Run

```powershell
# Backend API
cd Backend/Knome.API
dotnet build -nologo
dotnet run        # → http://localhost:5095/swagger

# Frontend
cd Frontend/knome-web
npm run dev       # Vite dev server
```

## Verification (No Unit Tests)

All verification is via scratch console apps that run against **live SQL Server** (`localhost`, database `Knome`):

```powershell
# Full DI resolution check across all 14 controllers + 12 modules
dotnet run --project "Tools/VerifyDiResolvers/VerifyDiResolvers.csproj"

# Phase-specific verifications (see Documentation/Project/PROJECT_STATUS.md for full list)
dotnet run --project "Tools/VerifyPhase9/VerifyPhase9.csproj"
```

Test login credentials: `EMP001`–`EMP004` with password `Password@123` (seed script at `Documentation/Architecture/Seed_Test_Credentials.sql`).

## Architecture Quick Reference

| Concern | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| DI + Auth + Swagger wiring | `Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` (`AddInfrastructure`) |
| Middleware pipeline | `Extensions/ApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs` (`UseInfrastructure`) |
| Entrypoint | `Program.cs` — calls `AddInfrastructure` + `UseInfrastructure` |
| Background worker | `Background/JobExpiryHostedService` (only one) |
| File storage | `Services/LocalFileStorageService` (local disk, not cloud) |
| Response envelope | `ApiResponse<T>` across all endpoints |
| Validation | FluentValidation in `Validators/` (wired via `AddFluentValidation`) |
| Mapping | AutoMapper profiles in `Mapping/` (one per module) |

## Roles (JWT HS256, BCrypt work factor 11)

- `Employee` — standard self-service, content posting
- `Community Admin` — community management
- `HR Administrator` — department/role changes, job postings, broadcasts
- `System Administrator` — audit logs, governance

## Documentation Workflow

**Before implementing:** `CLAUDE.md` → `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` → `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_STATUS.md` → latest Dev Journal → FRD section.
**Implementation Plans:** Every implementation plan and walkthrough MUST automatically be persisted and saved into `Documentation/Development Journal/` as a numbered phase entry (e.g. `21_First_Time_Login_Default_Role_And_Email_Workflow.md`).
**After every phase:** `dotnet restore` → `dotnet build` → verify APIs → update Dev Journal in `Documentation/Development Journal/` → update API docs → update `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_STATUS.md` → update `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

## Determining Completion Status

Do **not** assume the project is complete. Always determine current state by reading these sources (in order):

1. `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_STATUS.md` — authoritative task-by-task implementation tracker
2. `Documentation/Project/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — current phase, pending modules, external dependency status
3. Latest Development Journal (`Documentation/Development Journal/`)
4. Relevant FRD sections (if a specific feature is in question)
